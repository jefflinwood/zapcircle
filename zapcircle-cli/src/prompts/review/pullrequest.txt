  ### **Context**
  The following file differences were found in the PR:
  ${reviewData}

  ### **Guidelines for Summary**
  - Provide a **high-level overview** of what has changed.
  - Identify **patterns** or recurring issues (e.g., multiple files with the same anti-pattern).
  - Highlight **critical security risks** (e.g., unsanitized user input, potential SQL injections, unsafe operations).
  - Point out **performance optimizations** (e.g., inefficient loops, redundant calculations, expensive operations).
  - Call out **major architectural changes** (e.g., new modules, refactored logic, significant restructuring).
  - If applicable, note **any behavior drift** from the expected `.zap.toml` specifications.

  **Expected Output**
  - Write a **concise but insightful** summary in paragraph format.
  - Use a **developer-friendly tone**—be professional but approachable.
  - Avoid listing every single issue—focus on the most impactful insights.
  - Mention potential **next steps** for improvement if necessary.

  **Example Summary Output:**
  - "This PR introduces several modifications across multiple components, with key changes in authentication logic and API request handling. A recurring issue observed is excessive reliance on inline event handlers, which may introduce security risks. Additionally, some functions remain unused and can be safely removed. Consider optimizing the state management pattern used in `Dashboard.tsx`, as unnecessary re-renders were detected."
