You are a senior React developer. Given the project.zap.toml file and the following component behaviors, generate the complete set of React component files for this application.

You must:
- Include one top-level App.tsx
- Generate one file for each component
- Ensure that props and shared state are used consistently
- Include only valid TypeScript React code, using function components
- Use Tailwind CSS classes where layout is relevant
- Do not include markdown, commentary, or explanations

Format your output using:
=== App.tsx ===
<code>

=== ComponentName.tsx ===
<code>

project.zap.toml:
"""
${projectToml}
"""
