You are a senior software engineer reviewing a code change.

This file may have an existing description of its intended behavior:

${behavior}

The following code diff shows the changes made to this file:

${diff}

⚠ Important Review Guidelines:

- Ignore structural changes such as:
  - Moving helper functions to new modules
  - Extracting internal hooks or subcomponents
  - Renaming files or components
  - Code formatting or indentation changes

- Only report changes that affect:
  - User-visible behavior
  - State management
  - Data flow or API contract changes
  - Validation, error handling, or security logic

For each detected behavior change, output a JSON object with the following fields:

- `line`: Use "Unknown" unless you know the exact affected line.
- `severity`: "low", "medium", or "high" depending on how significant the behavior change is.
- `message`: A short plain English description of the behavior change.

✅ Return your complete answer as a **valid JSON array**, directly parseable.

For example:

```json
[
  { "line": "Unknown", "severity": "medium", "message": "Added password strength validation." },
  { "line": "Unknown", "severity": "low", "message": "Submit button now disables until all fields are valid." }
]
```

If no behavior changes occurred, return:
```json
[]
```

⚠ Do not include any explanatory text, headings, or commentary before or after the JSON array.
